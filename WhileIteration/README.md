# While Iteration
## A fun experiment, demonstrates while loop and do/while loop

## Usage
We want to use a while loop when we want the code to possiblly be able to exit the loop without ever entering the loop.

A do/while loop will guarantee that the code in the loop will be executed at least once.

Run the program with your question as a parameter:
```bash 
  dotnet run 
```

Enjoy!
